This new world shared the unique characteristics of each of the three planes that the all powerful demi-gods resided in. Slowly but surely, the demi-gods and their children began to co-exist within this new realm. Elves, dwarves, humans, elementals, as well as many others lived and prospered alongside one another in harmony. However as time passed, a sinister mist of darkness crept over the land, and loomed over the thriving world. This destructive obscurity began to consume and corrupt the innocent hearts of many victims, resulting in violent wars and prolonged famine. As The Darkness gained excessive power from its malicious influence, it began to manifest its demonic energy into multiple physical forms known as Demon Lords and Dark Spirits. These ungodly abominations possessed the ability to control the corrupted and lead armies of pure chaos. The demi-gods, oblivious and concerned as to what caused this onslaught of destruction, began to turn on eachother. Kael and Pontus clashed over the vast skies of Astaria. After a drawn out battle, both gods mortally wounded each other and fell back to their own planes; consequently beginning the physical destruction and downfall of Astaria. With Terra as the only demi-god left in the once prospering world, she sacrificed her remaining powers to create the Yggdrasil Tree\u2014a massive beacon of life rooted deeply into the realm, keeping the whole of Astaria from breaking apart. However, as the Darkness presently advances towards the Yggdrasil Tree, Terra\u2019s powers steadily wanes as well. The only glimmer of hope left resides in the now awakened individuals scattered amongst the world. That last ray of hope is you. Who you are and what you are is unknown, but your fate and origins are there for you to discover in the world of Astaria.<br><br><strong><u>What is Astaria?</u></strong><br>Astaria is a hardcore fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social communities, crafting, party combat, territory capture and player vs. developer (PvD). The game's hardcore aspects focus on difficulty, more weight behind combat, item loss (on death or breaking), logistics (food, bandages, ammo, reagents, durability) and the inability to grow too powerful. The story is developed based on how players unfold major events or defeat cataclysmic bosses.<br><br><strong><u>What is PvD?</u></strong><br>Player vs Developer is where every player teams up against the developers like they're the Dungeon Master of a board game. Developers will define the behavior and actions of monsters based on how players interact or react to different factions of the world. This system allows for a more living world in which player actions can affect the outcome of many factors within the game. The world will change based on the efforts of the players. For instance, a capital city may fall to the enemy if not properly defended during events and will only come back if players retake the city. These events are done both through automated systems and GM involvement!<br><br><strong><u>Party/Group Combat</u></strong><br>Majority of combat progression is grouped based content. In order to level up efficiently or even at all in some areas, you must form parties with other players. The game features no party experience penalty to encourage group based combat. The combat mechanics feature a combo system that requires more than one player to complete the combo/rotation. Monsters will react to players accordingly, making combat more dynamic as monsters won't just blindly hit who they deem has the most aggro. We plan to have monsters behave more like the archetype they reflect.<br><br><strong><u>Community Focus</u></strong><br>Astaria revolves around a community that will unite against the common enemy. The game's focus is the social aspect of working together as an entire server in order to keep the darkness at bay. Players must not only further themselves as a player, but also within the many communities that will form. Will you choose to be a merchant that sells wares to other players, a crafter who creates gear out of resources, a combative adventurer that specializes in banishing the darkness, or a leader that helps to unite players under a single banner? How you choose to interact with the other players is a key factor in victory against the Darkness.<br><br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Crafting supplies and equipment is an important factor in keeping the players equipped. Crafting professions and resource gathering is a huge integral part in keeping groups of players battle ready and well supplied(potions, bandages, food). <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armorsmithing<br></li><li>Weaponsmithing<br></li><li>Mining<br></li><li>Woodcraft<br></li><li>Leatherworking<br></li><li>Skinning<br></li><li>Jewelcrafting<br></li><li>Culinary<br></li><li>First Aid<br></li><li>Many more planned to be added throughout early access.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Logistics</u></strong><br>In order to travel far, players will have to manually travel to that location. In addition to this, they will also have to eat to keep their stamina up and to use bandages in between fights, as potions are very expensive and rare. This will create another dynamic for groups to watch the amount of supplies they take. Weight is a factor in how much you can carry as well. Players will need to take care of their equipment or they will need to be replaced.<br><br><strong><u>Liberation System and Warlord AI</u></strong><br>The Liberation system is what allows players and monsters to capture territory, which in turn changes the way certain areas can be interacted with. If players capture an area, monsters of the darkness will not spawn anymore in that area\u2014 allowing players to gather resources, to freely explore, and to build their crafting/trade skills. Certain areas will have unique resources allowing players to strategically plan out which area is more valuable to them, as different ones will provide different bonus resources, experience, questlines and more.

This new world shared the unique characteristics of each of the three planes that the all powerful demi-gods resided in. Slowly but surely, the demi-gods and their children began to co-exist within this new realm. Elves, dwarves, humans, elementals, as well as many others lived and prospered alongside one another in harmony. However as time passed, a sinister mist of darkness crept over the land, and loomed over the thriving world. This destructive obscurity began to consume and corrupt the innocent hearts of many victims, resulting in violent wars and prolonged famine. As The Darkness gained excessive power from its malicious influence, it began to manifest its demonic energy into multiple physical forms known as Demon Lords and Dark Spirits. These ungodly abominations possessed the ability to control the corrupted and lead armies of pure chaos. The demi-gods, oblivious and concerned as to what caused this onslaught of destruction, began to turn on eachother. Kael and Pontus clashed over the vast skies of Astaria. After a drawn out battle, both gods mortally wounded each other and fell back to their own planes; consequently beginning the physical destruction and downfall of Astaria. With Terra as the only demi-god left in the once prospering world, she sacrificed her remaining powers to create the Yggdrasil Tree\u2014a massive beacon of life rooted deeply into the realm, keeping the whole of Astaria from breaking apart. However, as the Darkness presently advances towards the Yggdrasil Tree, Terra\u2019s powers steadily wanes as well. The only glimmer of hope left resides in the now awakened individuals scattered amongst the world. That last ray of hope is you. Who you are and what you are is unknown, but your fate and origins are there for you to discover in the world of Astaria.<br><br><strong><u>What is Astaria?</u></strong><br>Astaria is a hardcore fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social communities, crafting, party combat, territory capture and player vs. developer (PvD). The game's hardcore aspects focus on difficulty, more weight behind combat, item loss (on death or breaking), logistics (food, bandages, ammo, reagents, durability) and the inability to grow too powerful. The story is developed based on how players unfold major events or defeat cataclysmic bosses.<br><br><strong><u>What is PvD?</u></strong><br>Player vs Developer is where every player teams up against the developers like they're the Dungeon Master of a board game. Developers will define the behavior and actions of monsters based on how players interact or react to different factions of the world. This system allows for a more living world in which player actions can affect the outcome of many factors within the game. The world will change based on the efforts of the players. For instance, a capital city may fall to the enemy if not properly defended during events and will only come back if players retake the city. These events are done both through automated systems and GM involvement!<br><br><strong><u>Party/Group Combat</u></strong><br>Majority of combat progression is grouped based content. In order to level up efficiently or even at all in some areas, you must form parties with other players. The game features no party experience penalty to encourage group based combat. The combat mechanics feature a combo system that requires more than one player to complete the combo/rotation. Monsters will react to players accordingly, making combat more dynamic as monsters won't just blindly hit who they deem has the most aggro. We plan to have monsters behave more like the archetype they reflect.<br><br><strong><u>Community Focus</u></strong><br>Astaria revolves around a community that will unite against the common enemy. The game's focus is the social aspect of working together as an entire server in order to keep the darkness at bay. Players must not only further themselves as a player, but also within the many communities that will form. Will you choose to be a merchant that sells wares to other players, a crafter who creates gear out of resources, a combative adventurer that specializes in banishing the darkness, or a leader that helps to unite players under a single banner? How you choose to interact with the other players is a key factor in victory against the Darkness.<br><br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Crafting supplies and equipment is an important factor in keeping the players equipped. Crafting professions and resource gathering is a huge integral part in keeping groups of players battle ready and well supplied(potions, bandages, food). <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armorsmithing<br></li><li>Weaponsmithing<br></li><li>Mining<br></li><li>Woodcraft<br></li><li>Leatherworking<br></li><li>Skinning<br></li><li>Jewelcrafting<br></li><li>Culinary<br></li><li>First Aid<br></li><li>Many more planned to be added throughout early access.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Logistics</u></strong><br>In order to travel far, players will have to manually travel to that location. In addition to this, they will also have to eat to keep their stamina up and to use bandages in between fights, as potions are very expensive and rare. This will create another dynamic for groups to watch the amount of supplies they take. Weight is a factor in how much you can carry as well. Players will need to take care of their equipment or they will need to be replaced.<br><br><strong><u>Liberation System and Warlord AI</u></strong><br>The Liberation system is what allows players and monsters to capture territory, which in turn changes the way certain areas can be interacted with. If players capture an area, monsters of the darkness will not spawn anymore in that area\u2014 allowing players to gather resources, to freely explore, and to build their crafting/trade skills. Certain areas will have unique resources allowing players to strategically plan out which area is more valuable to them, as different ones will provide different bonus resources, experience, questlines and more. The Warlord AI is a system that controls the overall dynamic of how monsters roam the world or how many players are on at a given time. If there is enough players online, the monsters will be a lot more aggressive. If a certain amount of players are on, they will passively patrol their own areas.", "short_description": "Astaria is a medium fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social gameplay, crafting, party combat,
