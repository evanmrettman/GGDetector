This new world shared the unique characteristics of each of the three planes that the all powerful demi-gods resided in. Slowly but surely, the demi-gods and their children began to co-exist within this new realm. Elves, dwarves, humans, elementals, as well as many others lived and prospered alongside one another in harmony. However as time passed, a sinister mist of darkness crept over the land, and loomed over the thriving world. This destructive obscurity began to consume and corrupt the innocent hearts of many victims, resulting in violent wars and prolonged famine. As The Darkness gained excessive power from its malicious influence, it began to manifest its demonic energy into multiple physical forms known as Demon Lords and Dark Spirits. These ungodly abominations possessed the ability to control the corrupted and lead armies of pure chaos. The demi-gods, oblivious and concerned as to what caused this onslaught of destruction, began to turn on eachother. Kael and Pontus clashed over the vast skies of Astaria. After a drawn out battle, both gods mortally wounded each other and fell back to their own planes; consequently beginning the physical destruction and downfall of Astaria. With Terra as the only demi-god left in the once prospering world, she sacrificed her remaining powers to create the Yggdrasil Tree\u2014a massive beacon of life rooted deeply into the realm, keeping the whole of Astaria from breaking apart. However, as the Darkness presently advances towards the Yggdrasil Tree, Terra\u2019s powers steadily wanes as well. The only glimmer of hope left resides in the now awakened individuals scattered amongst the world. That last ray of hope is you. Who you are and what you are is unknown, but your fate and origins are there for you to discover in the world of Astaria.<br><br><strong><u>What is Astaria?</u></strong><br>Astaria is a hardcore fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social communities, crafting, party combat, territory capture and player vs. developer (PvD). The game's hardcore aspects focus on difficulty, more weight behind combat, item loss (on death or breaking), logistics (food, bandages, ammo, reagents, durability) and the inability to grow too powerful. The story is developed based on how players unfold major events or defeat cataclysmic bosses.<br><br><strong><u>What is PvD?</u></strong><br>Player vs Developer is where every player teams up against the developers like they're the Dungeon Master of a board game. Developers will define the behavior and actions of monsters based on how players interact or react to different factions of the world. This system allows for a more living world in which player actions can affect the outcome of many factors within the game. The world will change based on the efforts of the players. For instance, a capital city may fall to the enemy if not properly defended during events and will only come back if players retake the city. These events are done both through automated systems and GM involvement!<br><br><strong><u>Party/Group Combat</u></strong><br>Majority of combat progression is grouped based content. In order to level up efficiently or even at all in some areas, you must form parties with other players. The game features no party experience penalty to encourage group based combat. The combat mechanics feature a combo system that requires more than one player to complete the combo/rotation. Monsters will react to players accordingly, making combat more dynamic as monsters won't just blindly hit who they deem has the most aggro. We plan to have monsters behave more like the archetype they reflect.<br><br><strong><u>Community Focus</u></strong><br>Astaria revolves around a community that will unite against the common enemy. The game's focus is the social aspect of working together as an entire server in order to keep the darkness at bay. Players must not only further themselves as a player, but also within the many communities that will form. Will you choose to be a merchant that sells wares to other players, a crafter who creates gear out of resources, a combative adventurer that specializes in banishing the darkness, or a leader that helps to unite players under a single banner? How you choose to interact with the other players is a key factor in victory against the Darkness.<br><br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Crafting supplies and equipment is an important factor in keeping the players equipped. Crafting professions and resource gathering is a huge integral part in keeping groups of players battle ready and well supplied(potions, bandages, food). <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armorsmithing<br></li><li>Weaponsmithing<br></li><li>Mining<br></li><li>Woodcraft<br></li><li>Leatherworking<br></li><li>Skinning<br></li><li>Jewelcrafting<br></li><li>Culinary<br></li><li>First Aid<br></li><li>Many more planned to be added throughout early access.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Logistics</u></strong><br>In order to travel far, players will have to manually travel to that location. In addition to this, they will also have to eat to keep their stamina up and to use bandages in between fights, as potions are very expensive and rare. This will create another dynamic for groups to watch the amount of supplies they take. Weight is a factor in how much you can carry as well. Players will need to take care of their equipment or they will need to be replaced.<br><br><strong><u>Liberation System and Warlord AI</u></strong><br>The Liberation system is what allows players and monsters to capture territory, which in turn changes the way certain areas can be interacted with. If players capture an area, monsters of the darkness will not spawn anymore in that area\u2014 allowing players to gather resources, to freely explore, and to build their crafting/trade skills. Certain areas will have unique resources allowing players to strategically plan out which area is more valuable to them, as different ones will provide different bonus resources, experience, questlines and more.

This new world shared the unique characteristics of each of the three planes that the all powerful demi-gods resided in. Slowly but surely, the demi-gods and their children began to co-exist within this new realm. Elves, dwarves, humans, elementals, as well as many others lived and prospered alongside one another in harmony. However as time passed, a sinister mist of darkness crept over the land, and loomed over the thriving world. This destructive obscurity began to consume and corrupt the innocent hearts of many victims, resulting in violent wars and prolonged famine. As The Darkness gained excessive power from its malicious influence, it began to manifest its demonic energy into multiple physical forms known as Demon Lords and Dark Spirits. These ungodly abominations possessed the ability to control the corrupted and lead armies of pure chaos. The demi-gods, oblivious and concerned as to what caused this onslaught of destruction, began to turn on eachother. Kael and Pontus clashed over the vast skies of Astaria. After a drawn out battle, both gods mortally wounded each other and fell back to their own planes; consequently beginning the physical destruction and downfall of Astaria. With Terra as the only demi-god left in the once prospering world, she sacrificed her remaining powers to create the Yggdrasil Tree\u2014a massive beacon of life rooted deeply into the realm, keeping the whole of Astaria from breaking apart. However, as the Darkness presently advances towards the Yggdrasil Tree, Terra\u2019s powers steadily wanes as well. The only glimmer of hope left resides in the now awakened individuals scattered amongst the world. That last ray of hope is you. Who you are and what you are is unknown, but your fate and origins are there for you to discover in the world of Astaria.<br><br><strong><u>What is Astaria?</u></strong><br>Astaria is a hardcore fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social communities, crafting, party combat, territory capture and player vs. developer (PvD). The game's hardcore aspects focus on difficulty, more weight behind combat, item loss (on death or breaking), logistics (food, bandages, ammo, reagents, durability) and the inability to grow too powerful. The story is developed based on how players unfold major events or defeat cataclysmic bosses.<br><br><strong><u>What is PvD?</u></strong><br>Player vs Developer is where every player teams up against the developers like they're the Dungeon Master of a board game. Developers will define the behavior and actions of monsters based on how players interact or react to different factions of the world. This system allows for a more living world in which player actions can affect the outcome of many factors within the game. The world will change based on the efforts of the players. For instance, a capital city may fall to the enemy if not properly defended during events and will only come back if players retake the city. These events are done both through automated systems and GM involvement!<br><br><strong><u>Party/Group Combat</u></strong><br>Majority of combat progression is grouped based content. In order to level up efficiently or even at all in some areas, you must form parties with other players. The game features no party experience penalty to encourage group based combat. The combat mechanics feature a combo system that requires more than one player to complete the combo/rotation. Monsters will react to players accordingly, making combat more dynamic as monsters won't just blindly hit who they deem has the most aggro. We plan to have monsters behave more like the archetype they reflect.<br><br><strong><u>Community Focus</u></strong><br>Astaria revolves around a community that will unite against the common enemy. The game's focus is the social aspect of working together as an entire server in order to keep the darkness at bay. Players must not only further themselves as a player, but also within the many communities that will form. Will you choose to be a merchant that sells wares to other players, a crafter who creates gear out of resources, a combative adventurer that specializes in banishing the darkness, or a leader that helps to unite players under a single banner? How you choose to interact with the other players is a key factor in victory against the Darkness.<br><br><strong><u>Crafting</u></strong><br>Crafting supplies and equipment is an important factor in keeping the players equipped. Crafting professions and resource gathering is a huge integral part in keeping groups of players battle ready and well supplied(potions, bandages, food). <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Armorsmithing<br></li><li>Weaponsmithing<br></li><li>Mining<br></li><li>Woodcraft<br></li><li>Leatherworking<br></li><li>Skinning<br></li><li>Jewelcrafting<br></li><li>Culinary<br></li><li>First Aid<br></li><li>Many more planned to be added throughout early access.</li></ul><br><strong><u>Logistics</u></strong><br>In order to travel far, players will have to manually travel to that location. In addition to this, they will also have to eat to keep their stamina up and to use bandages in between fights, as potions are very expensive and rare. This will create another dynamic for groups to watch the amount of supplies they take. Weight is a factor in how much you can carry as well. Players will need to take care of their equipment or they will need to be replaced.<br><br><strong><u>Liberation System and Warlord AI</u></strong><br>The Liberation system is what allows players and monsters to capture territory, which in turn changes the way certain areas can be interacted with. If players capture an area, monsters of the darkness will not spawn anymore in that area\u2014 allowing players to gather resources, to freely explore, and to build their crafting/trade skills. Certain areas will have unique resources allowing players to strategically plan out which area is more valuable to them, as different ones will provide different bonus resources, experience, questlines and more. The Warlord AI is a system that controls the overall dynamic of how monsters roam the world or how many players are on at a given time. If there is enough players online, the monsters will be a lot more aggressive. If a certain amount of players are on, they will passively patrol their own areas.", "short_description": "Astaria is a medium fantasy MMORPG with emphasis on social gameplay, crafting, party combat,

possibilities of the game, including a final proposition that encourages the player to think critically about the topics that are treated in this project.\r\nThe tutorial then allows the player to get familiar with the core game mechanics: the Monthly Development, Actions &amp; Events and Advancements.\r\nFinally the 8 game panels are shown and explained. \r\n\r\n\r\n+ Added Background Music\r\na set of pieces that accompanies the game experience.\r\n*note that the first load of a new version of the game might restrict the playlist to the 1st pieces only.

The macroeconomic and political developments of the single countries affect prices as well as public perception.\r\nRemember, every move that you make, every context-driven event that happens, has an impact on your company and will manifest sooner or later. \r\n\r\n\r\nChoose your own path: a greedy profit-centric corporation or a social and environmental conscious company. It all depends on you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMango Cart is a turn-based game: every month you get mandatory tasks to complete and events to check before advancing to the next stage. Additionally, a number of actions are available to you at any time, and a set of external events will pop-up when you least expect them.\r\n\r\nThere are several game-ending scenarios but no game-winning target. You can potentially play the game endlessly. At the start of each new year your performance is compared with 4 your competitors: this is where you can check if your company is progressing as expected.\r\n\r\nExpect more features, new and enhanced game mechanics with the upcoming releases\u2026\r\n\r\n...and join the community or simply contact AkriGames to suggest new events or things you would like to see added to the game.", "about_the_game": "Mango Cart is about trading mangoes between two countries. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuy the fruit stock in the producing country or grow it yourself, arrange the transportation and sell the final production in the receiving country.

Check out our stretch goals to see how you can get your favorite Justice's story unlocked!<br><br>And now, without further ado, let\u2019s meet the bench!<br><br><strong>Chief Justice John Roberts</strong><br>They don\u2019t call him Chief Justice for nothing - as the leader of the Court, Roberts role is to safeguard justice itself. He\u2019s your no-nonsense, stern-but-kind-hearted Court Daddy (though don\u2019t ever let him hear you call him that). He presides over the bench with one rule in mind - never lower the integrity of the Court.<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy</strong><br>Kennedy has been on the Court longer than anyone else, and he won\u2019t stop reminding everyone about it. As the hot and cold swing vote on the Court, Kennedy is used to people trying to convince him onto their side, and he doesn\u2019t make it easy!<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</strong><br>Known as the Notorious R.B.G. both on and off the Court, Ginsburg is a stand out presence. It\u2019s well known not to take her soft spoken demeanor for granted, as she is always ready to cut down injustice with her impeccably structured dissents. She\u2019s an unrelenting liberal powerhouse that won\u2019t back down no matter what!<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Clarence Thomas</strong><br>Infamous for his silent demeanor on the Court, there\u2019s more than meets the eye with Thomas. Contrasting Ginsburg as the most conservative presence on the Court, swaying Thomas\u2019 opinions can be harder than moving mountains.<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Stephen Breyer</strong><br>More than any other, Breyer judges with his heart. A firm believer that caring is not a weakness, he works to make sure the Court is thinking of the people, not the policies. Some would say Breyer is an open book (or a chatterbox), but Breyer would say he just likes to share!<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Samuel Alito</strong><br>Alito is not known for holding his tongue on the bench. Active, competitive and direct, Alito aims to take the shortest path to reaching his goals. Though he can butt heads with other members of the Court, he\u2019s more thrilled by the competition rather than the outcome.<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor</strong><br>Sotomayor is forever looking forward, and her aspirations for the future keep her fighting for social change and growth within the Court. She\u2019s always open with her opinions, and will do what she can to get you on her side. Above all, Sotomayor knows that the Court will make history, and she wants to make sure it\u2019s the right kind of history.<br><br><strong>Associate Justice Elena Kagan</strong><br>Before your arrival, Elena Kagan was the Court\u2019s newest member, so she still feels like she has a lot to prove. While the other may take a broad view, she zooms in on the minutiae on which entire cases hinge, building her position from the ground up. She\u2019ll be eager to share her analyses, assuming you can keep up!<br><br><strong>And... You?</strong><br>As the newly appointed - and totally unqualified - ninth Justice, it's your job to learn how the Supreme Court works, and how your new colleagues approach certain issues. No big deal, right..?<br><br>Players can choose their Justice from one of two highly-expressive avatars, as well as the pronoun they prefer to use (he, she, they). Neither will affect the story or which Justices the player can befriend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>Supreme Courtship takes place in a fictional present-day Washington D.C.  After a mysterious death leaves a vacancy on the Court, you are appointed to fill the open seat!<br><br>What's that? You don't know anything about the Constitution? Or the Court? Or the rule of law?? Too bad they didn't ask you about any of that before they picked you for the position. Oh well, I'm sure you'll figure it out!<br><br>You'll learn your job on-the-fly with the help of your eight honorable colleagues and dutiful law clerks. Earn the esteem of your fellow Justices, cast votes on pivotal court cases, and untangle a political mystery that threatens the very foundation of our Democracy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>Supreme Courtship is a visual novel game along the lines of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, with interesting characters, dramatic courtroom scenes, exciting locations to visit, and a central mystery. Players will have a lot of freedom and choice - after all, making impactful decisions is what being a judge is all about! Players can choose their character, what to do in their free time, which Justices to talk to, and how to investigate a chilling murder. Most importantly, though, players will learn about, argue, and cast a vote on a number of real-life court cases - and their decisions will have lasting impacts on the characters and the story.<br><br>Supreme Courtship takes a page from the dating sim genre by offering character-focused side-stories and the ability to track and grow your friendship (or &quot;esteem&quot;) with the other Justices. Raising your esteem with a Justice will unlock special segments of the story, and fill you in on the Justice's background and philosophy.

The player never sees a violent act being committed (e.g. you never see someone dying, just the aftermath).\r\n\r\nThough the game got an ESRB descriptor of \"sexual themes,\" these are limited to: allusions to an affair between two characters; one character's confession of possible love for another.
